# This is a heading
The headings appear as sections in the table of content.

## This is a heading 2
This is a paragraph.   
markdown text can have *italics*, **bold**, `monospace` and ~~strikethrough~~ in it. \uline{underline text isn't a thing in markdown tho}, but u can do it in LaTex, and in <u>HTML</u> too, LaTex has \uuline{dunderline text} as well.

This is a new paragraph, separated from the previous by two newlines.   
In order to have a line break in a paragraph, you need to end the line before it with two or three spaces.

The table of contents is automatically generated by vscode from the headings.

# Version Control??
Yep! You can use git to version control your markdown files, and vscode has a built in git interface. You can also use github to host your markdown files, kinda as a backup and a way to share them with others.

<!--
##### heading 5
And this too, but LateX doesn't support headings 5 and 6
